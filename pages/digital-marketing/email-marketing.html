            mails should be designed to be visually appealing and easy to read.

            follow-up emails, without manual intervention.

            <h3>What is sms marketing?</h3>
            <p>
              Short message service (SMS) marketing is a direct marketing
              strategy that involves sending promotional messages, offers,
              updates or otp to customers via text messages on their mobile
              phones. It allows businesses to reach their audience instantly,
              offering a high engagement rate due to the immediacy and personal
              nature of SMS.
