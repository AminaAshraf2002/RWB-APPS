          Tomsher is a premier Digital marketing agency in Dubai, offering Pay
          Per Click (PPC) ad campaigns to corporate and start-up companies. PPC
          (pay-per-click) marketing is a form of paid online advertising and
          advertisers accrue costs when users click their ads. Google PPC is a
          powerful cost-effective way to raise brand awareness and drive
          qualified traffic to your site, boosting sales and other conversions.
          Our Google PPC ads services include keyword research, ad copywriting,
          campaign setup and management, landing page optimization, and
          performance reporting. Choose the right keywords to reach relevant
          searches. Keywords match your ads with the terms people are searching
          for. PPC bidding helps you connect with customers while managing your
          budget. Smart Bidding uses machine learning to automatically set bids
          that help you reach your performance goals, maximize ROI, and save
          time. Google Ads (formerly Google AdWords): Google Ad is one of the
          most popular and widely used advertising platform. Google ads run on
          the Google search engine, Search Partner sites, and Display Network
          sites. Microsoft Advertising (formerly Bing Ads): Similar to Google
          Ads, Microsoft Advertising is a pay-per-click platform showing ads on
          the Microsoft and Yahoo networks. Amazon pay per click (PPC) Ads:
          Amazon ads is one of the best options for targeting eCommerce shoppers
          on Amazon. There are 3 Amazon ad types available: Sponsored Products,
          Sponsored Brands, and Sponsored Display Ads.
