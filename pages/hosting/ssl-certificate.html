        <h1>SSL Certificate & Installation</h1>
      </div>

      <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 1rem">
        <p>
          SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) Certificates are globally recognized
          security certificates that secure websites. Also known as Digital
          Certificates, they create an encrypted communication link between a
          web server and a browser. When a website is SSL certified, it shows a
          lock symbol in the browser, ensuring secure communication between the
          website and its visitors.
        </p>
        <div>
          <h1>What is SSL Certificate?</h1>
          <p>
            SSL Secure Socket Layer SSL is the standard security technology used
            to establish an encrypted link between a web server and a browser.
            This encrypted link ensures that all data passed between them
            remains private, secure, and safe.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h1>What is HTTPS?</h1>
          <p>
            HTTPS Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer
            Protocol Secure) is a secure version of HTTP. When using HTTPS,
            computers agree on a shared "code" to scramble messages. This makes
            the communication unreadable to anyone trying to intercept it, thus
            keeping your information safe from hackers.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h1>Mark your site “Not Secure”</h1>
          <p>
            Today, Google strongly encourages implementing SSL as the best
            practice for secure websites. Not having SSL could not only
            jeopardize your website’s security but also result in lost revenue.
            Websites without SSL certification are flagged as "Not Secure,"
            which could deter users from visiting and engaging with the site.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h1>What are the impacts of not having SSL?</h1>
          <p>
            As more online businesses transition to secure websites, SSL
            certification will become a necessary standard for success. Websites
            lacking SSL will be viewed as less trustworthy, potentially losing
            customers who prefer to engage only with secure sites. Having an SSL
            certificate is essential for building trust and achieving long-term
            online success.

          <h1>EV SSL Certificate</h1>
          <p>
            EV SSL Certificates are extended validation certificates, the most
            secure among the three types of SSL certificates. They involve a
            stringent vetting process to validate and verify the legitimacy of
            the entity requesting the certificate. When a website is secured
            with an authorized EV SSL Certificate, users will see a green
            address bar in their browser. This green address bar helps build
            customer trust, enhancing credibility and significantly increasing
            conversion rates.

          <h1>OV SSL Certificate</h1>
          <p>
            OV (Organization Validated) SSL Certificates provide full business
            and company validation. Each OV certificate includes the company’s
            name and address details, offering a higher level of trust to users.
            Compared to Domain Validated certificates, OV SSL certificates
            provide significantly greater assurance to end-users, ensuring the
            legitimacy of the organization behind the website.

          <h1>DV SSL Certificate</h1>
          <p>
            DV (Domain Validated) SSL Certificates provide the same high levels
            of data encryption as the other types, but they do not display the
            green address bar and do not offer assurance about the identity of
            the business behind the website. These certificates are a popular
            choice for small or startup websites due to their faster issuance
            times and lower price points, making them an affordable option for
            basic website security.

              numbers, etc., from hackers and data thieves.

              announced that having an SSL certificate is one of the easiest
              ways for website owners to improve their SEO rankings.

              in more potential customers and reduced shopping cart abandonment.

              unaltered, preventing anyone from tampering with the information
              during transit.
