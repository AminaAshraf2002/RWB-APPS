        <p>
          Tomsher is a premium web portal development company in Dubai,
          providing B2B & B2C web portal development services. B2B
          (business-to-business) portal is the easiest way to promote products
          or services to corporate and companies. B2B portals serve as a digital
          marketplace where businesses can buy and sell products or services,
          manage orders, and communicate with their partners, suppliers, and
          distributors. B2B portals typically display a comprehensive catalog of
          products or services offered by the participating businesses. This
          allows potential buyers to browse and search for items they need. B2B
          portals often include RFQ functionality, enabling buyers to request
          quotes from multiple suppliers for specific products or services.
        </p>
        <p>
          B2C portals, also known as Business-to-Consumer portals, are the
          products/services online store for individual consumers. B2C portals
          typically showcase a wide range of products or services with detailed
          descriptions, images, pricing information, and bundle offers. B2C
          portals often offer the option for users to create accounts, which can
          provide benefits like order tracking, personalized recommendations,
          and easier future purchases. B2C companies know that if customers are
          not attracted or purchased during the first visit to the website, they
          may lose that potential customer. In B2C websites, selling
          straight-to-consumer often happens within one website browsing
          session. The product purchase happens after the customer checked
          multiple other sites, reviews, and ratings, and compares prices, and
          brands.
