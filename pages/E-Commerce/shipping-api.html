          <h1>Displaying delivery date</h1>
          <p>
            Shopping online brings the convenience of seeing all product info
            and making purchases with the added bonus of an estimated delivery
            date. This helps customers make informed decisions when buying.

          />
          <h1>Tracking Orders</h1>
          <p>
            Shipping API integrations enable customers to stay up to date on
            their packages' progress, sending them real-time tracking updates
            with each delivery milestone crossed such as pick-up, on the way,
            and out for delivery. This helps customers feel the excitement and
            anticipation of receiving their order.

          <h1>Streamline Cancellations</h1>
          <p>
            Cancellations are an unavoidable part of running an eCommerce
            business. To reduce the chance of orders becoming lost or stuck in
            transit when cancelled, it is important to act quickly and begin the
            return journey of the order as soon as possible
          </p>
        </div>

          <h1>Manage NDRs</h1>
          <p>
            Non-delivery reports (NDRs) are notifications made by shipping
            partners to eCommerce businesses that a delivery attempt has failed.
            If the delivery is not successful after multiple re-attempts, it can
            become a return to origin (RTO) situation.
