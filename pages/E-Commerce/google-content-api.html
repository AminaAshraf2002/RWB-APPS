        <h1>Google content API for Shopping</h1>
      </div>

      <div class="content-section">
        <p>
          The Content API for Shopping can be used to streamline the management
          of Google Merchant Center accounts. Its features include uploading
          products, tracking inventory, managing orders and returns, linking to
          Google Ads, and taking advantage of other Google for Retail solutions
          such as Shopping campaigns and Buy on Google. However, merchants must
          abide by Shopping Ads and Free Listings policies, and Google Shopping
          has the right to enforce compliance with these policies. Google
          Content API is a set of web services used to programmatically access
          and manage Google Merchant Center product data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Merchants who have an account with Google Shopping can utilize the
          products resource to create an online store catalog. This resource
          consists of a list of available products and offers. Through the
          Content API, merchants have the ability to quickly update, create, and
          delete product information, in contrast to managing multiple
          supplemental feeds. It may take a few hours for changes made via API
          calls to show in the Shopping Merchant Center database, however this
          is still far faster than other methods. Adherence to Shopping ads and
          free listings policies is expected from all merchants.
