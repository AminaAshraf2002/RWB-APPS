          look for products or services. By optimizing your product pages,
          category structure, site speed, and mobile usability, SEO helps bring
          in more qualified traffic without relying on paid ads. This increased
          visibility drives organic clicks, boosts trust, and leads to more
          conversions over time—especially important for online stores competing
